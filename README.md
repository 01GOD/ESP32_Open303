# ESP32 Open303
ESP32 port of the Open303 : TB303 bassline clone. 
Original is here https://github.com/RobinSchmidt/Open303
Audio output is I2S bus, so you need just some devboard and an I2S DAC like PCM5102.
This port is at its initial state, it lacks controls, but handles noteOn, noteOff, cutoff, reso and some other MIDI messages.
Contributors are welcome.
